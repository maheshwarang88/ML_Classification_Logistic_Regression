# ML_Classification_Logistic_Regression
Classification by using Logistic Regression
In this Program we will try to classify depending on whether user going to by a XUV or not by using simple linear classification technique ie Logistic Regression.

The Steps will be as follows
1)Importing the libraries
2)Importing the dataset
3)Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
4)Feature Scaling
5)Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
6)Predicting the Test set results
7)Making the Confusion Matrix
8)Visualising the Training set results
9)Visualising the Test set results
